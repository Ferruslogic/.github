## Hi there 👋

### We are a very small team, of great friends

🙋‍♀️ We have been studying  and working together for a long time, enough to feel and treat each other as a family of different blood. With many differences and many points in common. Some of those commonalities are an interest in teaching, software development, and a good cup of hot coffee.

👩‍💻 Our specialty is the development of modern and cross-platform applications. We preferably develop in [LiveCode](https://livecode.com), this is not our only tool. But if the one we use the most.
