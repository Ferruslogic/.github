## Hi there 👋

### We are a very small team, of great friends

We have been together for a long time, enough to feel and treat each other as a family of different blood. With many differences and many points in common. Some of those commonalities are an interest in teaching, software development, and a good cup of hot coffee.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
